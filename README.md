# Fork-join-flood-solver

Made for the class: **CSC 375 - Parallel Programing**

In this project I focused on the java Fork/Join framework. This code is ment to solve many Flood configurations. The Flood class is responsible for all of the customization of the board. The code is complete with a swing interface that shows the progress of the solution.
